/*
 This can't be tested in our test environment right now.
 Node does not include all of the language data needed
 to do proper sorting. There is a module `full-icu` that
 you can use to give node access to all the language
 data but it will not install with yarn as per this issue
 https://github.com/unicode-org/full-icu-npm/issues/9
 Another alternative would be to use the Intl polyfill
 but that does not include support for Collators. Thus
 there is no way to test this yet
