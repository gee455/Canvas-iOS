//
//  Manages the time between app startup and when the first view controller's view appears on the screen
//
//  There is a really awkward time between when the app launches and when you can do post app launch things
//  For example:
//      - Starting up React Native. This can take a while as our entire javascript source needs to be parsed
//      - Routing. There are millions of reason why routing doesn't work right off the bat. The view heiarchy might not be setup and or other issues
//
//  This manager makes sense of all that craziness by taking in blocks that need to be executed post app launch. Once a view controller actually appears on the screen,
//  those blocks are then executed.
//
//  Also manages the launch screen placeholder and animations
